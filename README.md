# Engineering Note App

## Introduction

The **Engineering Note App** is a mobile application built with Flutter and Dart that allows engineers to create, organize, and share technical notes and project documentation. This app is designed to help engineers keep track of their work, collaborate with team members, and store important information in a structured manner.

The primary goal of this project is to provide a convenient tool for managing engineering notes and projects efficiently.

## Features

- **Note Creation and Management:** Create, edit, and organize notes with rich text formatting.
- **Project Documentation:** Maintain project notes and documentation in a structured format.
- **File Attachments:** Attach images, PDFs, and other files to notes.
- **Collaborative Features:** Share notes with team members and collaborate in real-time.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find notes using keywords and tags.
- **Offline Access:** Access your notes even without an internet connection.
- **Cloud Sync:** Sync your notes across devices using cloud services.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile.
- **Dart:** The programming language for developing the application.
- **Firebase:** For backend services like authentication, database, and cloud storage.
- **Provider:** State management solution in Flutter.
- **RichTextEditor:** For advanced note editing and formatting.
- **Cloud Firestore:** For real-time database services.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version 3.0 or above)
- Android Studio or Xcode (for iOS)
- Firebase account for backend services

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/engineering-note-app.git
